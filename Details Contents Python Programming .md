# 1. Introduction.
## **Brife History of Python:-**
  
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. it was initially designed by **Guido Van Rossum** in **1991** and developed by Python Software Foundation. it was mainly devveloped to emphasize code readability. and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

**Who invented Python?**

Python was invented by **Guido van Rossum** in The late 1980s. He  began working on it in December 1989 at the Centrum Wiskunda  & information (CWI) in the Netherlands. intially started ass a hobby project to keep him occcupied during Chrstmas, Python was designed to be an inproved successor to the ABC programming language, which Guido had previously workrd on He took the syntax and many features from ABC but fixed its shotcomings, creating a powerful scripting language that would go on to become python.

**Why Python called Python?**

The inspiration for the name came from the BBC’s TV Show – ‘ Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ , as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.

**Evolution of Python:-**
The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java , C++ & C . Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released, it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types of exception handling and functions.

- You can now start writing Python code using any text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VS Code, or IDLE (which comes with Python).

By following these steps, Python should be successfully installed on your Windows system, and you'll be ready to start coding!

## **Environment Variables**

Environment variables in Python are key-value pairs that are set outside the program and are used to configure the behavior of running applications. These variables are part of the operating system's environment, and they can be accessed within Python scripts to influence the script's operation or to provide it with necessary configuration data.

### Key Points about Environment Variables in Python:

1. **Operating System Level Configuration**:  
   Environment variables are typically set at the operating system level and can be accessed by all programs running in that environment, not just Python scripts. They can be used to store information like system paths, user preferences, API keys, and other configuration data.

2. **Accessing Environment Variables**:  
   In Python, you can access environment variables using the `os` module. Here's how you can access them:

   ```python
   import os
   
   # Accessing an environment variable
   db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST')
   print(db_host)
   ```

   - The `os.getenv()` function returns the value of the environment variable named `'DB_HOST'`. If the environment variable does not exist, it returns `None` (or you can specify a default value as a second argument).

3. **Setting Environment Variables**:
   - In Python, you can set environment variables temporarily for the duration of the script execution using `os.environ`:
   
   ```python
   import os
   
   os.environ['MY_VAR'] = 'my_value'
   print(os.getenv('MY_VAR'))  # Output: my_value
   ```

   - These variables will only be available while the script is running and will not persist once the script ends.

4. **Using Environment Variables**:
   - Environment variables are often used to manage settings for different environments, like development, testing, and production, without changing the code. For example, you can store database credentials or API keys in environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your codebase.

5. **Common Use Cases**:
   - **Path Configuration**: Setting paths for executables and libraries.
   - **Configuration Settings**: Managing settings like debug modes, feature flags, or service endpoints.
   - **Sensitive Information**: Storing API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data.

6. **Managing Environment Variables**:
   - **Windows**: You can manage environment variables via the System Properties > Environment Variables dialog.
   - **Linux/MacOS**: You can manage them in the shell using commands like `export` (for setting) and `echo` (for reading).
   - **.env Files**: In development, environment variables are often stored in a `.env` file and loaded using a package like `python-dotenv`.

### Example of Using Environment Variables:

```python
import os

# Retrieve environment variables
api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY', 'default_key')

# Use the environment variable
if api_key == 'default_key':
    print("Warning: Using default API key")
else:
    print(f"API Key: {api_key}")
```

In this example, the script attempts to get the value of the `API_KEY` environment variable. If it's not set, it defaults to `'default_key'`.

### Why Use Environment Variables?

- **Security**: Keep sensitive information out of your codebase.
- **Flexibility**: Easily switch configurations without modifying the code.
- **Portability**: Write code that works in different environments (e.g., development vs. production) with the same configuration mechanism.

Understanding and using environment variables effectively allows you to write more secure, flexible, and portable Python applications.

## **Executing Python from the Command Line:-**

Executing Python from the command line allows you to run Python scripts or interact with the Python interpreter directly from your terminal or command prompt. Here's a step-by-step guide to running Python from the command line on various operating systems.

### Step 1: Install Python
First, ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation on Windows, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** to make Python accessible from the command line.

### Step 2: Open the Command Line

- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
- **macOS**: Open Spotlight (`Cmd + Space`), type `Terminal`, and press Enter.
- **Linux**: Open your terminal application (varies by distribution).

### Step 3: Verify Python Installation

To verify that Python is correctly installed and accessible from the command line, type:

```bash
python --version
```
or

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is installed, it will display the version number. If not, you may need to ensure Python is correctly installed or that it's added to your system's `PATH`.

### Step 4: Running the Python Interpreter

To start the Python interpreter (an interactive shell where you can type Python commands), type:

```bash
python
```
or

```bash
python3
```

You'll enter the Python interactive mode, where you can type Python commands directly and see the results. For example:

```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```

Exit the interpreter by typing `exit()` or pressing `Ctrl + Z` followed by Enter on Windows, or `Ctrl + D` on macOS/Linux.

### Step 5: Running Python Scripts

To execute a Python script from the command line:

1. **Navigate to the Script's Directory**:
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example:

   ```bash
   cd C:\Python Programming\
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/script
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Once in the directory, run the script by typing:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py
   ```

   Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file.

### Example:

Suppose you have a Python script called `hello.py` containing the following code:

```python
print("Hello from Python!")
```

To run this script:

1. Open the command line.
2. Navigate to the directory where `hello.py` is located.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python hello.py
   ```

The output will be:

```bash
Hello from Python!
```

### Step 6: Passing Arguments to a Python Script

You can pass arguments to your Python script via the command line. For example, if you have a script that accepts arguments:

```python
import sys

# Print command-line arguments
print("Arguments:", sys.argv)
```

Run the script with arguments like this:

```bash
python script_name.py arg1 arg2 arg3
```

The `sys.argv` list will contain the script name as the first element, followed by any arguments you passed (`arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3` in this case).

### Troubleshooting

- **Command Not Recognized**: If the `python` command is not recognized, make sure Python is installed correctly and added to your `PATH`. On Windows, reinstall Python and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation.
- **Using `python3` on macOS/Linux**: On some systems, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`, as `python` might refer to Python 2.x.

By following these steps, you can easily execute Python scripts and interact with the Python interpreter directly from the command line, which is an essential skill for Python developers.

## **Dynamic Types:-**

In Python, dynamic typing is a feature that allows variables to hold values of any type and that type can change during program execution. This flexibility is a core aspect of Python’s design, and it has significant implications for how you write and manage code. Here’s an overview of dynamic typing in Python:

### What is Dynamic Typing?

Dynamic typing means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than at compile-time. This allows you to assign different types of values to the same variable throughout the execution of your program.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Type Flexibility**:
   - Variables do not have a fixed type. You can reassign a variable to different types of values as needed.

   ```python
   x = 10        # x is an integer
   x = "Hello"   # Now x is a string
   x = [1, 2, 3] # Now x is a list
   ```

2. **Type Inference**:
   - Python automatically infers the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it. You do not need to explicitly declare types.

   ```python
   a = 5          # Python infers that a is an integer
   b = 3.14       # Python infers that b is a float
   c = "Python"   # Python infers that c is a string
   ```

3. **Dynamic Type Checking**:
   - Type checking occurs at runtime, so errors related to types (e.g., adding an integer to a string) are detected when the code is executed.

   ```python
   num = 10
   text = "Number: "
   result = text + num  # This will raise a TypeError at runtime
   ```

### Advantages of Dynamic Typing

1. **Ease of Use**:
   - Dynamic typing simplifies the coding process because you don't need to specify types explicitly. This can make code shorter and easier to write.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Variables can be reassigned to different types, which is useful for writing generic and flexible code. This is particularly beneficial in scripting and rapid development.

3. **Polymorphism**:
   - Functions and methods can operate on arguments of various types, leading to more generic and reusable code.

### Disadvantages of Dynamic Typing

1. **Runtime Errors**:
   - Errors related to types are only caught at runtime, which can lead to unexpected crashes or bugs if type mismatches occur.

2. **Reduced Performance**:
   - Dynamic type checking can introduce overhead compared to statically typed languages, potentially affecting performance in type-heavy operations.

3. **Lack of Type Safety**:
   - Without explicit type declarations, it can be harder to understand what type of data is being used, which may lead to misunderstandings or misuse of variables.

### Type Annotations (Optional)

Python supports type hints and annotations as part of the typing module introduced in Python 3.5. These annotations allow you to indicate the expected types of variables, function arguments, and return values. They do not enforce type checking but can improve code readability and help with static analysis tools.

#### Example of Type Annotations:

```python
from typing import List, Union

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

def process_items(items: List[Union[int, str]]) -> None:
    for item in items:
        print(item)

# Example usage
print(greet("Alice"))
print(add_numbers(5, 7))
process_items([1, 2, 'three', 4])
```

In this example:
- `greet` function expects a `str` argument and returns a `str`.
- `add_numbers` function expects two `int` arguments and returns an `int`.
- `process_items` function expects a list containing integers or strings.

### Conclusion

Dynamic typing is a powerful feature of Python that contributes to its flexibility and ease of use. While it provides advantages in terms of rapid development and coding simplicity, it also comes with challenges like potential runtime errors and reduced type safety. Understanding how dynamic typing works and leveraging optional type annotations can help you write more robust and maintainable Python code.

## **Python Reserved Words:-**

In Python, reserved words (also known as keywords) are special identifiers that have predefined meanings in the language syntax. These words cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names) because they are reserved by the language itself.

Here’s a list of Python reserved words and an explanation of their purpose:

### List of Python Reserved Words

#### Python 3.11 (and later versions)

```python
False       # Boolean value False
None        # Represents the absence of a value
True        # Boolean value True
and         # Logical AND operator
as          # Used for creating an alias
assert      # For debugging, used to check conditions
break       # Terminates the nearest enclosing loop
class       # Used to define a new class
continue    # Continues with the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop
def         # Used to define a function
del         # Deletes objects
elif        # Used in conditional statements, after if
else        # Used in conditional statements
except      # Catches exceptions in try-except blocks
finally     # Used with try to ensure code runs no matter what
for         # Starts a for loop
from        # Imports specific parts of a module
global      # Declares a global variable
if          # Starts an if statement
import      # Imports a module
in          # Tests membership in a sequence
is          # Tests object identity
lambda      # Creates an anonymous function (lambda function)
nonlocal    # Declares a non-local variable
not         # Logical NOT operator
or          # Logical OR operator
pass        # A null statement, used as a placeholder
raise       # Raises an exception
return      # Exits a function and optionally returns a value
try         # Starts a try block for exception handling
while       # Starts a while loop
with        # Used to wrap the execution of a block with methods
yield       # Produces a value from a generator function
```

### Checking Reserved Words in Python

You can use the `keyword` module in Python to programmatically check reserved words. Here’s how:

1. **Import the `keyword` Module**:
   ```python
   import keyword
   ```

2. **List All Keywords**:
   ```python
   print(keyword.kwlist)
   ```

   This will print a list of all the reserved words in the current version of Python.

3. **Check if a Word is a Keyword**:
   ```python
   print(keyword.iskeyword('if'))  # True
   print(keyword.iskeyword('my_var'))  # False
   ```

### Example Usage

Here’s a simple Python script that demonstrates how to use some of these reserved words:

```python
def greet(name):
    if name:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    else:
        return "Hello, World!"

try:
    message = greet("Alice")
    print(message)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

In this example:
- `def` is used to define the function `greet`.
- `if` and `else` are used for conditional statements.
- `try` and `except` are used for exception handling.

### Conclusion

Reserved words in Python are fundamental to the language’s syntax and structure. They cannot be used as identifiers and have specific roles that contribute to the language’s functionality. Understanding and correctly using these reserved words is crucial for effective Python programming.

## **Naming Conventions:-**

Naming conventions in Python are guidelines that help you write code that is clean, readable, and maintainable. Following naming conventions consistently makes your code easier to understand and collaborate on. Here are the commonly accepted naming conventions in Python:

### 1. **Variable and Function Names**

- **Lowercase with Underscores**: Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores to improve readability.
  ```python
  variable_name = "value"
  function_name(parameter_one, parameter_two)
  ```

  Example:
  ```python
  def calculate_area(radius):
      return 3.14 * radius * radius
  ```

### 2. **Class Names**

- **CamelCase**: Use CamelCase (also known as PascalCase) where each word starts with a capital letter and no underscores are used.
  ```python
  class MyClass:
      pass
  ```

  Example:
  ```python
  class RectangleAreaCalculator:
      def __init__(self, width, height):
          self.width = width
          self.height = height
          
      def calculate_area(self):
          return self.width * self.height
  ```

### 3. **Constants**

- **UPPERCASE with Underscores**: Use all uppercase letters with underscores to separate words. Constants are usually defined at the top of a module or script.
  ```python
  MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100
  PI = 3.14159
  ```

### 4. **Module and Package Names**

- **Lowercase with Underscores**: Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words. This convention helps distinguish module and package names from classes and functions.
  ```python
  import my_module
  from my_package import my_submodule
  ```

### 5. **Private Variables and Methods**

- **Single Underscore Prefix**: Use a single leading underscore to indicate that a variable or method is intended for internal use (i.e., it is "private").
  ```python
  _internal_variable = 10
  def _private_method():
      pass
  ```

  - **Double Underscore Prefix**: Use double leading underscores for name mangling to avoid name conflicts in subclasses.
    ```python
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self):
            self.__private_variable = 10
    ```

### 6. **Special Methods**

- **Double Leading and Trailing Underscores**: Use double leading and trailing underscores for special methods (also known as magic methods or dunder methods). These are predefined methods used by Python’s syntax and semantics.
  ```python
  def __init__(self):
      pass

  def __str__(self):
      return "String representation of the object"
  ```

  Examples include:
  - `__init__` (constructor)
  - `__str__` (string representation)
  - `__repr__` (official string representation)
  - `__len__` (length of an object)

### 7. **Global Variables**

- **Use with Caution**: Global variables are generally avoided in favor of passing variables to functions or using class attributes. When used, follow the constant naming convention to indicate their special status.

  ```python
  GLOBAL_VARIABLE = "value"
  ```

### Example Code

Here’s a Python code example that illustrates these naming conventions:

```python
# Constants
PI = 3.14159

# Class Name
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius  # Private variable

    def calculate_area(self):
        return PI * self._radius ** 2

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Circle with radius {self._radius}"

# Function Name
def print_circle_area(circle):
    print(f"Area of the circle: {circle.calculate_area()}")

# Module-Level Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_circle = Circle(5)
    print_circle_area(my_circle)
```

### Summary

Following Python’s naming conventions helps create code that is:
- **Readable**: Easy to understand at a glance.
- **Consistent**: Maintains uniformity across the codebase.
- **Maintainable**: Simplifies collaboration and future modifications.

Adhering to these conventions is a best practice that contributes to the overall quality and professionalism of your Python code.
