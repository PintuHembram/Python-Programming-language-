# 1. Introduction.
- **Brife History of Python:-**
  
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. it was initially designed by **Guido Van Rossum** in **1991** and developed by Python Software Foundation. it was mainly devveloped to emphasize code readability. and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

**Who invented Python?**

Python was invented by **Guido van Rossum** in The late 1980s. He  began working on it in December 1989 at the Centrum Wiskunda  & information (CWI) in the Netherlands. intially started ass a hobby project to keep him occcupied during Chrstmas, Python was designed to be an inproved successor to the ABC programming language, which Guido had previously workrd on He took the syntax and many features from ABC but fixed its shotcomings, creating a powerful scripting language that would go on to become python.

**Why Python called Python?**

The inspiration for the name came from the BBC’s TV Show – ‘ Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ , as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.

**Evolution of Python:-**
The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java , C++ & C . Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released, it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types of exception handling and functions.

+  **Python Version.**
  
**Following are the illustrations of different versions of Python along with the timeline.**

1. **The Birth of Python 0.9.0(1991):-** Python’s journey began with version 0.9.0, released by Guido van Rossum in 1991. This initial release included core features such as exception handling, functions, and the core data types: list, dict, str, and others. It also introduced the module system, allowing the organization of code into reusable libraries.
2. **Python 1.0 (1994) Early Versions and Growth:-** Python 1.0 marked the official public release, bringing in significant features such as:

+ Lambda, Map, Filter, and Reduce: Functional programming constructs that allowed concise and powerful data manipulation.
+ Exception Handling: A structured way to handle errors and exceptions in code.
  
**Python 1.5(1997):-** Version 1.5 introduced important updates, including:

- Standard Library Enhancements: Expansion of the standard library, making Python more versatile.
- Unicode Support: Initial support for Unicode, facilitating internationalizatio
3. **Establishing a Strong Foundation**
  
**Python 2.0 (2000)**

Python 2.0 was a pivotal release that laid the groundwork for modern Python with:

- **List Comprehensions:-** A syntactic construct for creating lists based on existing lists.
- **Garbage Collection:-** Automatic memory management to reclaim unused memory.
- **Unicode Support:-** Full support for Unicode, enabling better handling of international text.
  
**Python 2.7 (2010)**
  
Python 2.7 was the final major release in the Python 2.x series, bringing several features from Python 3.x to ease the transition:

- **Ordered Dictionaries:-** Dictionaries that maintain the insertion order of keys.
- **Set Literals:-** A more convenient way to define sets.
- **Improved Syntax:-** Enhanced syntax features, including more robust error handling and new string formatting methods.
