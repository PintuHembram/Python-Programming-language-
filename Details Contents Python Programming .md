# 1. Introduction.
## **Brife History of Python:-**
  
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. it was initially designed by **Guido Van Rossum** in **1991** and developed by Python Software Foundation. it was mainly devveloped to emphasize code readability. and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

**Who invented Python?**

Python was invented by **Guido van Rossum** in The late 1980s. He  began working on it in December 1989 at the Centrum Wiskunda  & information (CWI) in the Netherlands. intially started ass a hobby project to keep him occcupied during Chrstmas, Python was designed to be an inproved successor to the ABC programming language, which Guido had previously workrd on He took the syntax and many features from ABC but fixed its shotcomings, creating a powerful scripting language that would go on to become python.

**Why Python called Python?**

The inspiration for the name came from the BBC’s TV Show – ‘ Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ , as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.

**Evolution of Python:-**
The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java , C++ & C . Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released, it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types of exception handling and functions.

## **Python Version:-**
  
**Following are the illustrations of different versions of Python along with the timeline.**

**1. The Birth of Python 0.9.0(1991):-**

Python’s journey began with version 0.9.0, released by Guido van Rossum in 1991. This initial release included core features such as exception handling, functions, and the core data types: list, dict, str, and others. It also introduced the module system, allowing the organization of code into reusable libraries.

**2. Python 1.0 (1994) Early Versions and Growth:-** 

Python 1.0 marked the official public release, bringing in significant features such as:

+ Lambda, Map, Filter, and Reduce: Functional programming constructs that allowed concise and powerful data manipulation.
+ Exception Handling: A structured way to handle errors and exceptions in code.
  
**Python 1.5(1997):-**

Version 1.5 introduced important updates, including:

- Standard Library Enhancements: Expansion of the standard library, making Python more versatile.
- Unicode Support: Initial support for Unicode, facilitating internationalizatio
**3. Establishing a Strong Foundation**
  
**Python 2.0 (2000)**

Python 2.0 was a pivotal release that laid the groundwork for modern Python with:

- **List Comprehensions:-** A syntactic construct for creating lists based on existing lists.
- **Garbage Collection:-** Automatic memory management to reclaim unused memory.
- **Unicode Support:-** Full support for Unicode, enabling better handling of international text.
  
**Python 2.7 (2010)**
  
Python 2.7 was the final major release in the Python 2.x series, bringing several features from Python 3.x to ease the transition:

- **Ordered Dictionaries:-** Dictionaries that maintain the insertion order of keys.
- **Set Literals:-** A more convenient way to define sets.
- **Improved Syntax:-** Enhanced syntax features, including more robust error handling and new string formatting methods.

  **4. The Shift to Python 3**
  
**Python 3.0 (2008)**

Python 3.0, also known as “Python 3000” or “Py3k,” was a revolutionary release designed to fix inconsistencies and remove redundant constructs from Python 2.x:

- **Print Function:** print became a function, enhancing consistency and flexibility.
- **New Syntax and Semantics:** Changes to integer division, Unicode string handling, and more.
- **Removal of Deprecated Features:** Simplification of the language by removing outdated features.
  
**Python 3.4 (2014)**

Version 3.4 introduced several significant enhancements:

- **Asyncio:** A framework for writing asynchronous programs, allowing for concurrent code execution.
- **Pathlib:** An object-oriented filesystem paths library.
  
**Python 3.5 (2015)**

Python 3.5 brought in important features for modern programming:

- **Type Hints:** A syntax for adding type annotations to function arguments and return values.
- **Async and Await:** Syntactic support for asynchronous programming, making async code more readable and maintainable.
  
 **5. Modern Python**
 
**Python 3.6 (2016)**

Python 3.6 was a landmark release with multiple enhancements:

- **Formatted String Literals (f-strings):** A concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals.
- **Underscores in Numeric Literals:** Improved readability of large numbers.
- **Asynchronous Generators:** Enhancements to asynchronous programming.
  
**Python 3.7 (2018)**

This version focused on performance and new features:

- **Data Classes:** A decorator for automatically generating special methods like __init__ and __repr__ in classes.
- **Context Variables:** A way to manage context-local state.
  
**Python 3.8 (2019)**

Python 3.8 introduced several new features and optimizations:

- **Walrus Operator (:=):** An assignment expression that allows assignment and return of a value within an expression.
- **Positional-only Parameters:** A way to specify arguments that can only be passed positionally.
  
**Python 3.9 (2020)**

Python 3.9 continued to enhance the language:

- **Dictionary Merge and Update Operators:** New operators | and |= for merging and updating dictionaries.
- **String Methods:** New methods like str.removeprefix() and str.removesuffix().
  
**Python 3.10 (2021)**

Python 3.10 focused on usability and language consistency:

- **Pattern Matching:** A powerful feature for matching complex data structures.
- **Parenthesized Context Managers:** Support for multiple context managers in a single with statement.
  
**Python 3.11 (2022)**

Python 3.11 aimed at improving performance and developer experience:

- **Performance Improvements:** Significant speed improvements across various operations.
- **Error Messages:** More informative and precise error messages.
  
**Python 3.12 (2023)**

The future release of Python 3.12 bring more optimizations and features, continuing the evolution of the language.

+ Improved Error Messages in Python
+ More Flexibility in Python F-String
+ Type Parameter Syntax
+ Improvement in Modules
+ Syntactic Formalization of f-strings
  **Python 3.13 (2024)**
The future release of Python 3.12 is expected to bring more optimizations and features, continuing the evolution of the language.
