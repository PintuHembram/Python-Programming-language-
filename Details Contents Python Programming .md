# 1. Introduction.
## **Brife History of Python:-**
  
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. it was initially designed by **Guido Van Rossum** in **1991** and developed by Python Software Foundation. it was mainly devveloped to emphasize code readability. and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

**Who invented Python?**

Python was invented by **Guido van Rossum** in The late 1980s. He  began working on it in December 1989 at the Centrum Wiskunda  & information (CWI) in the Netherlands. intially started ass a hobby project to keep him occcupied during Chrstmas, Python was designed to be an inproved successor to the ABC programming language, which Guido had previously workrd on He took the syntax and many features from ABC but fixed its shotcomings, creating a powerful scripting language that would go on to become python.

**Why Python called Python?**

The inspiration for the name came from the BBC’s TV Show – ‘ Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ , as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.

**Evolution of Python:-**
The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java , C++ & C . Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released, it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types of exception handling and functions.

   - Run `python -m venv myenv` to create a virtual environment named `myenv`.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - Run `myenv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment.
   - The Command Prompt will now show `(myenv)` before the command line, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

3. **Install Packages**:
   - You can now use `pip` to install packages within this virtual environment, e.g., `pip install requests`.

4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:
   - When you're done, type `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment.

### Step 5: Start Coding!
- You can now start writing Python code using any text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VS Code, or IDLE (which comes with Python).

By following these steps, Python should be successfully installed on your Windows system, and you'll be ready to start coding!

## **Environment Variables**

Environment variables in Python are key-value pairs that are set outside the program and are used to configure the behavior of running applications. These variables are part of the operating system's environment, and they can be accessed within Python scripts to influence the script's operation or to provide it with necessary configuration data.

### Key Points about Environment Variables in Python:

1. **Operating System Level Configuration**:  
   Environment variables are typically set at the operating system level and can be accessed by all programs running in that environment, not just Python scripts. They can be used to store information like system paths, user preferences, API keys, and other configuration data.

2. **Accessing Environment Variables**:  
   In Python, you can access environment variables using the `os` module. Here's how you can access them:

   ```python
   import os
   
   # Accessing an environment variable
   db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST')
   print(db_host)
   ```

   - The `os.getenv()` function returns the value of the environment variable named `'DB_HOST'`. If the environment variable does not exist, it returns `None` (or you can specify a default value as a second argument).

3. **Setting Environment Variables**:
   - In Python, you can set environment variables temporarily for the duration of the script execution using `os.environ`:
   
   ```python
   import os
   
   os.environ['MY_VAR'] = 'my_value'
   print(os.getenv('MY_VAR'))  # Output: my_value
   ```

   - These variables will only be available while the script is running and will not persist once the script ends.

4. **Using Environment Variables**:
   - Environment variables are often used to manage settings for different environments, like development, testing, and production, without changing the code. For example, you can store database credentials or API keys in environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your codebase.

5. **Common Use Cases**:
   - **Path Configuration**: Setting paths for executables and libraries.
   - **Configuration Settings**: Managing settings like debug modes, feature flags, or service endpoints.
   - **Sensitive Information**: Storing API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data.

6. **Managing Environment Variables**:
   - **Windows**: You can manage environment variables via the System Properties > Environment Variables dialog.
   - **Linux/MacOS**: You can manage them in the shell using commands like `export` (for setting) and `echo` (for reading).
   - **.env Files**: In development, environment variables are often stored in a `.env` file and loaded using a package like `python-dotenv`.

### Example of Using Environment Variables:

```python
import os

# Retrieve environment variables
api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY', 'default_key')

# Use the environment variable
if api_key == 'default_key':
    print("Warning: Using default API key")
else:
    print(f"API Key: {api_key}")
```

In this example, the script attempts to get the value of the `API_KEY` environment variable. If it's not set, it defaults to `'default_key'`.

### Why Use Environment Variables?

- **Security**: Keep sensitive information out of your codebase.
- **Flexibility**: Easily switch configurations without modifying the code.
- **Portability**: Write code that works in different environments (e.g., development vs. production) with the same configuration mechanism.

Understanding and using environment variables effectively allows you to write more secure, flexible, and portable Python applications.

## **Executing Python from the Command Line:-**

Executing Python from the command line allows you to run Python scripts or interact with the Python interpreter directly from your terminal or command prompt. Here's a step-by-step guide to running Python from the command line on various operating systems.

### Step 1: Install Python
First, ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation on Windows, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** to make Python accessible from the command line.

### Step 2: Open the Command Line

- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
- **macOS**: Open Spotlight (`Cmd + Space`), type `Terminal`, and press Enter.
- **Linux**: Open your terminal application (varies by distribution).

### Step 3: Verify Python Installation

To verify that Python is correctly installed and accessible from the command line, type:

```bash
python --version
```
or

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is installed, it will display the version number. If not, you may need to ensure Python is correctly installed or that it's added to your system's `PATH`.

### Step 4: Running the Python Interpreter

To start the Python interpreter (an interactive shell where you can type Python commands), type:

```bash
python
```
or

```bash
python3
```

You'll enter the Python interactive mode, where you can type Python commands directly and see the results. For example:

```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```

Exit the interpreter by typing `exit()` or pressing `Ctrl + Z` followed by Enter on Windows, or `Ctrl + D` on macOS/Linux.

### Step 5: Running Python Scripts

To execute a Python script from the command line:

1. **Navigate to the Script's Directory**:
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example:

   ```bash
   cd C:\Python Programming\
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/script
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Once in the directory, run the script by typing:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py
   ```

   Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file.

### Example:

Suppose you have a Python script called `hello.py` containing the following code:

```python
print("Hello from Python!")
```

To run this script:

1. Open the command line.
2. Navigate to the directory where `hello.py` is located.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python hello.py
   ```

The output will be:

```bash
Hello from Python!
```

### Step 6: Passing Arguments to a Python Script

You can pass arguments to your Python script via the command line. For example, if you have a script that accepts arguments:

```python
import sys

# Print command-line arguments
print("Arguments:", sys.argv)
```

Run the script with arguments like this:

```bash
python script_name.py arg1 arg2 arg3
```

The `sys.argv` list will contain the script name as the first element, followed by any arguments you passed (`arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3` in this case).

### Troubleshooting

- **Command Not Recognized**: If the `python` command is not recognized, make sure Python is installed correctly and added to your `PATH`. On Windows, reinstall Python and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation.
- **Using `python3` on macOS/Linux**: On some systems, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`, as `python` might refer to Python 2.x.

By following these steps, you can easily execute Python scripts and interact with the Python interpreter directly from the command line, which is an essential skill for Python developers.
